The main game folder is inside Game8.0 folder which is inside Game9 folder.

Please mark the Test folder in src-main-Test folder as Test source Root.

We have used Multi-threading in this project in gameloop in GameScreen class. We have used Executor Service and have made 10 threads for smooth run of the game. We have also added a button to save and load game state at a particular point as bonus. Whereas, last score, high score and current score are saved and loaded automatically.

We have used singleton in GameState class and have used Factory Design Pattern in ScoreLabel and CherryLabel.

We have also added 5 test classes. When you run each file you will see test cases passed.

We have added all the needed images in resources folder. We have done exception handling and all OOPS as required.

In this , if hero collects a cherry then the scorelabel increases by 1.

Only working buttons are - :

1)At the start of game as playbutton
2) Load button while game is running
3) Save button while game is running
4) Revive, HomeScreen , Restart button when GameOver screen is shown
